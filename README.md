# Network VRF Configuration

Ansible role that defines the vrfs for networking devices. 

The configuration of the role is done so that it shouldn't be necessary to modify the role for any configuration.
All settings can be configured by changing role parameters or by declaring new config as variable.

Please report any issues or send PR.


Details from modules used: 
Cisco NX-OS creates the default VRF by itself. Therefore, youâ€™re not allowed to use default as vrf name in this module.
VRF names must be shorter than 32 characters and not case sensitive. 
## Examples

```yaml
